## 1.) Accordian With Single Display
So the accordian app took almost 1 Hour to complete and I practised it almost 3 to 4 times within that this time frame. Lot's of issues occurred like we must use proper JSX syntax to return JSX elements and we should not return JSX anywhere in the file because it may not render as expected. This was the first part of "Accordian App" where we toggle a Single Question and answer. After this we will see how to show multiple accordian.

2. Pass a key prop while rendering items from loops

## 2.) Accordian With Multiple Display
It's same as the above one but the key takeaway is that we have a button which basically controls the "Enabling" or "Disabling" of Single or Multiple Accordian. And based on the current state of button we call the function that handles Single or Multiple Accordian. The main problem occurred is that writing JSX Syntax. Majority of the time it was difficult to debug the correct JSX Syntax as it resulted in no render.

## 3.) Displaying Star Rating
This was quite a fun project because it looked simple but it wasn,t so. Used a third-party dependency "react-icon" to generate stars. Also, setting the hover effect to the stars was a tedious task as of now in this learning phase. It was so because you need to hold the previously clicked rating. However, if the user moved mouse to select a new rating the hover effect should be shown. The user may or may not select new rating but the hover effect should change everytime mouse enters or leaves the rating stars.
